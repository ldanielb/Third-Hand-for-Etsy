This is the first release of a bot I made for my wife to help her with her Etsy promotion duties. The program was written using Autohotkey, a scripting/automation language for Windows. 

When the program opens, it opens up an Internet Explorer window. The program uses that window to work on the Etsy webpage and make the clicks needed favorite or unfavorite an item. To protect user safety, the program does not store any data. The management of any cookies, credentials, or log in information is solely reliant on the IE. 

Please let me know if you would like any other features added, or if you run into any issues.
